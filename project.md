# Project Description

## Introduction
This project consists of the development of a data mining (DM) case study. The description of the application is provided in a separate page that can be found in moodle.

Two tasks will be addressed in the project: a descriptive DM task and predictive DM task. The descriptive data mining task is left to the choice of students. The predictive data mining task is defined in the case study description. The development of the project should be guided by a suitable methodology. The choice of methodology is left to the students.

## Rules
- The project will be developed by groups of 2 students.
- There will be a single delivery, to be made according to the instructions below and on the date indicated in the plan. Additionally, the plan contains dates when other results are expected, in order to help students monitor the progress of their work.

## Grading
- 50% of the project grade will be assigned based on the materials submitted in moodle and the presentation.
- the remaining 50% will be assigned based on the results on the predictive data mining task, as follows
  - a maximum grade will be assigned to the best result
  - a minimum grade will be assigned to the worst result
  - the other grades will assigned using a linear progression in the interval between the minimum and maximum grades

## Presentation guidelines
TBA

## Submission instructions
The predictions for the competition, will be submitted in Kaggle (further instructions to be provided later).
The presentation as well as any files that are required to reproduce the results (data, code, etc), will be submitted in moodle.
